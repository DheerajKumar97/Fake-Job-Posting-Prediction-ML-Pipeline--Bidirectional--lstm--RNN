# PROJECT GOAL

### This project is designed to predict the DRUG REVIEW SENTIMENT using Natural Language Processing with Python, FLASK, HTML, SQL.

### A highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, vectorization all steps are explained in detail.

# Project Motivation

**In today's world Data Science is slowing booming in health care and in future Data Science in health care will be in top noch and they are some issues people facing by consumming expired drugs which is not working for particular disease and creating other problem for patients, to avoid this decided to develop and sentiment analysis model to review the sentiments of drugs that would help people to make desicion about quality of drug**

# Requirements Installation

**The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository**

    pip install -r requirements.txt
