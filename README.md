# PROJECT GOAL

### This project is designed to predict the Fake Job Posting in Socal Medias using Natural Language Processing with Python, FLASK, HTML, SQL.

### A highly comprehensive analysis with all data cleaning, exploration, visualization, vectorization all steps are explained in detail.

# Project Motivation

**In today's world Tecnologies are increasing and creating revolutionary change in scientific world, due to that people are interested in learning new technologies so that requirements of job becoming less and graduates are more so institutions are growing more by advertising that they can bridge gap between industries and Graduates, in splite of this some of them are posting FAKE JOB POST to prevent that, i have decided to do this project**

# Requirements Installation

**The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository**

    pip install -r requirements.txt
